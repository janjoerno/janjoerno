    <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self. Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market dominance.</p>
    <p> Brendan Eich developed JavaScript at Netscape Communications in 1995. They created JavaScript as a scripting language for use with Netscape Navigator, the company's flagship web browser. Because Netscape owns the name "JavaScript," when it was added to Internet Explorer, it had to be officially called "JScript."</p>

    <p>The 5 year google trends shows that the graph is going down for javascript in comparison with python based on popularity, for me python becomes trending because many schools teach python not javascript in every years, also Phyton is popular becayse it' easier to use than javascript while learning to program for the first time. Java script is 25 years old but it is one of the most important language today.</p>

    <p>What is Vanilla JavaScript? It entails using JavaScript's built-in methods and objects without the use of any additional libraries or frameworks. VanillaJS is a forgery framework. It's essentially a satire/joke.</p>
